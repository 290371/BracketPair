# Bracket Pair Colorizer

This extension allows matching brackets to be identified with colours. The user can define which characters to match, and which colours to use.
## Features

### User defined matching characters
> By default (), [], and {} are matched, however custom bracket characters can also be configured.

> A list of colors can be configured, as well as a specific color for orphaned brackets.

### Fast

> Bracket Pair Colorizer will only update during configurable idle time.

> Bracket Pair Colorizer will only update iterative changes to the document, caching already parsed lines.

## Known Issues

* No Tests
* Brackets in comments are not ignored
